```

Important Information:

- Script requires at least one profile to be passed with the **required** `--profiles` flag
- If there are no named profiles configured, the script requires the `"default"` profile to be passed, eg: `--profiles default`
- To generate a list of all AWS profiles in `~/.aws/config`  on MacOS or Linux, you can run this command and copy/paste the result `awk '/\[profile / {gsub(/\[profile |\]/, ""); printf "%s ", $0}' ~/.aws/config | sed 's/ *$//'`
